Coding Foundations Project Requirements
CodePen.io is a relatively simple webpage that combines a number of things you already know, such as working with images, creating buttons, and text fields.
You can use the Visual Studio Code as your text editor. It is free, lightweight, and easy to use. Otherwise, you can use any other text editor you prefer.

Include these elements
•	Navbar that includes "Pens, Projects, Posts, Collections, and Spark with a down chevron (does not need to actually dropdown).
•	Images - use available tools to recreate colors, etc.
•	Don't worry about replicating any functionality features such as drop-down, scrolling, etc. Simply replicate the landing page.

Scoring criteria
•	Coding runs without errors
•	Includes all required elements
•	Accurate representation of the CodePen homepage
